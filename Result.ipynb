    "In this project we are looking to determine how the “best neighborhood\" is resource-rich and accessible for everyday living. A good neighborhood should make life easier, healthier and smarter for the residents. We are looking at three kinds of accessibility:  transit, healthcare, and education. Together, they are supporting how well the community supports people’s everyday lives.\n",
